How to Run The Program :

Run preferably on eclipse

1. Open one more Terminal. Lets call it Terminal 1. Compile all java codes with "javac *.java". This creates .class files for all .java codes
3. Run Server in Terminal 1 with command "java Server"
4. Run Client in Terminal 2 with command "java Client"

(NOTE : Run the Server before the Client)
